# OBS Hadowplay

## Introduction

In an attempt to move away from ShadowPlay and it's lack of customization, I thought I'd bring the useful functionality over to OBS.

Currently this includes automatic replay buffer start/stop based on a game capture within the active scene.

I'd love to add the functionality of moving replays into folders named after the game-capture subject, but currently this seems to be an impossabiltiy without changes to obs and it's plugins.

## Changelog

* v1.1.1

* * Added automatic replay organisation
* * * When a reply is saved, it will move the recording into a folder named after the top most application's ProductName


* v1.0.0

* * Initial release.
* * * Automatic activation of the replay buffer when a game-capture is detected as being active (width & height > 0)
* * * Manual replay buffer activation will not be stopped if a game-capture becomes inactive
* * * Manual replay buffer deactivation is possible and will restart once game-captures become inactive

Currently only tested on Windows-x64
