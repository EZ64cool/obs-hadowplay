# OBS Hadowplay

## Introduction

In an attempt to move away from ShadowPlay and it's lack of customization, I thought I'd bring the useful functionality over to OBS.

This includes automatic replay buffer start/stop based on hooked captures within the active scene and the organisation of replays/recordings into folders named after the capture subject.
